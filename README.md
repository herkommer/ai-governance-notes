## Purpose

This repository collects notes, frameworks, and references related to
human–AI interaction, decision systems, and governance in practice.

The focus is not on models or tooling, but on how AI systems are introduced,
used, and held accountable in real organizational contexts.

Material will be added gradually.


## Scope

Topics may include:
- Human–AI decision support
- Risk, trust, and responsibility
- Governance beyond compliance
- Organisational readiness
- Value creation under uncertainty


## Status

This is a living repository.
Some sections may remain empty for long periods.
That is by design.
