# Executive AI Review — Key Questions

Before approving or scaling an AI initiative, ask:

- What decision is being supported or automated?
- Who remains accountable for outcomes?
- What happens when the system is wrong?
- How is context change detected?
- Can this system be paused or reversed?

If these questions cannot be answered clearly,
the initiative is not ready.
