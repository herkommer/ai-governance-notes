# AI is NOT another IT Project

AI initiatives often fail not because of technical limitations,
but because they are framed as technology deployments rather than
organizational decisions.

Traditional IT projects focus on:
- requirements
- implementation
- delivery

AI systems change how decisions are made.
That shifts responsibility, accountability, and risk.

## Where the framing breaks

When AI is treated as IT:
- governance arrives too late
- accountability is blurred
- human judgment is bypassed instead of supported

## A different framing

AI should be approached as:
- decision support, not authority
- a change in operating model
- a governance challenge before a technical one

## Implications for leaders

Leaders do not need to understand models.
They need to understand:
- where judgment is delegated
- where responsibility remains
- what happens when systems fail

## Closing

The question is not whether AI works.
The question is whether the organization remains accountable
once AI is introduced.
