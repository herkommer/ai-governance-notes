# Human–AI Decision Boundaries

This framework helps clarify where AI may support decisions
and where human judgment must remain primary.

## Categories

1. Advisory
2. Recommendatory
3. Automated with oversight
4. Automated without oversight (rare, high risk)

## Boundary questions

- Who is accountable?
- Can the decision be reversed?
- What is the cost of error?
- Is context stable or changing?

## Usage

This framework is intended as a discussion tool,
not a compliance checklist.
